The government did not provide any reasons for this action, and Maneka Gandhi challenged this order in the Supreme Court, arguing that it violated her fundamental rights under Articles 14 (Right to Equality), 19 (Right to Freedom), and 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) of the Constitution.\n\n### Key Issues:\n\n1. **Whether the impounding of Maneka Gandhi's passport without providing reasons violated her right to personal liberty under Article 21.**\n2. **Whether the right to travel abroad is a part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21.**\n3. **Whether the procedure established by law for depriving a person of their personal liberty must be fair, just, and reasonable.**\n\n### Supreme Court's Judgment:\n\nThe Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment that significantly expanded the scope of Article 21. The key points of the judgment are as follows:\n\n1. **Interpretation of Article 21**: The Court held that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 is not merely animal existence but includes the right to live with human dignity. It encompasses a variety of rights that constitute the personal liberty of a person.\n\n\n2. **Right to Travel Abroad**: The Court ruled that the right to travel abroad is a part of the right to personal liberty under Article 21. Therefore, the impounding of Maneka Gandhi's passport without any reasons or opportunity to be heard violated her right to personal liberty.\n\n\n3. **Fair Procedure**: The Court emphasized that any law or executive action that deprives a person of their personal liberty must not only be in accordance with the procedure established by law but also be fair, just, and reasonable. The procedure must satisfy the principles of natural justice.\n\n\n4. **Expansion of Article 21**: The judgment expanded the scope of Article 21 by linking it with Articles 14 and 19. The Court held that any law that deprives a person of their personal liberty must also be tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 and 19.\n\n\n### Impact:\n\nThe Maneka Gandhi case is a landmark in Indian constitutional law as it broadened the interpretation of Article 21 and emphasized the importance of due process and fair procedure in matters affecting personal liberty. The judgment laid the foundation for the development of a rich jurisprudence on human rights and civil liberties in India.\n\nThis case is often cited in subsequent judgments and has played a crucial role in shaping the protection of individual rights against arbitrary state action in India."], ["exit", "I'm sorry, but I don't have information on \"ooga booga.\" Please update yourself.

Civil cases typically involve disputes between individuals or organizations, often concerning private rights such as contracts, property, or family matters. The goal of civil litigation is usually to resolve the dispute and provide remedies such as compensation or specific performance.\n\nOn the other hand, criminal cases involve offenses against the state or society as a whole, such as theft, assault, or murder. The objective of criminal prosecution is to punish the offender and deter future crimes. Criminal cases are initiated by the state through law enforcement agencies, and the outcome can result in penalties such as fines, imprisonment, or even capital punishment, depending on the severity of the offense.\n"], ["hey can you tell me the major common ipc sections?", "I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge base right now.
